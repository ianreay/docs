ProjectLibre
================================================================================

`ProjectLibre <http://www.projectlibre.org/>`_ is an open source tool with
resonable compatibility with :ref:`Microsoft Project <microsoft-project>` via
the xml file format. Most of my experience with it has been with respect to relatively simple projects with limited resource tracking.

Definatly worth checking out if you are looking for a low cost project
management solution that is roughly in line with Microsoft Project.
