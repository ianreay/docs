Visual Studio
================================================================================

I've used visual studio 2005 and 2008 and found them very functional. I don't
use them in my day to day coding though for the following reasons:

* The code sets I frequently work with are not structured in a visual studio
  frendly way and use a jam based compilation approach.
* Visual studio is not as screen real estate efficient as :ref:`vim <vim>`
  when.
* Visual studio can be resource intensive on large projects of multi-million
  lines of code which I frequently work with. 
* I prefer the :ref:`windbg <windbg>` debugger since I was originally trained
  on it and I primarily work in native code.

I do use visual studio when:
* I'm presented with a large unknown code base and I need to familiarize myself with it.
