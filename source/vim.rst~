Vim
=================================================

Books
-------------------------------------------------

`Practical VIM <http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim>`_ is a very
effective book. Lots of examples and well written.

Plugins
-------------------------------------------------

`Vundle <https://github.com/gmarik/vundle>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Vundle <https://github.com/gmarik/vundle>`_ plugin is pretty much
mandatory if you are doing software development with vim. While you should
strive to minimize the number of plugins you depend upon, some plugins are well
worth it, and Vundle makes loading them dead easy.

The site has a good tutorial on how to get going with it. Works well for windows.

`Vim-Commentary <https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Vim-Commentary <https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary>`_ is a really nice
plugin when you are editing code or latex files. It provides a very slick way
of commenting and uncommenting large chunks of code.

Also very useful when you are putting comments in your code. Just write
language as you normally would and the comment the paragraph.

`Python-mode <https://github.com/klen/python-mode>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Python-mode <https://github.com/klen/python-mode>`_ is a nearly mandatory
plugin if you are doing work with python in vim. Its main strengths are:

* `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style enforcement
* effective python auto indenting
* pylint code checking
 
Its well worth the small amount of time required to set it up.
