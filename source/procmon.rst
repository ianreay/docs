Process Monitor (procmon.exe)
================================================================================

Process monitor is probably the 2nd most useful IT utility after :ref:`Process
Explorer <procexp>`. It allows you to profile processes to learn how they
interact with files, registry keys, the network and other element of their
environment. Exceptionally useful.
